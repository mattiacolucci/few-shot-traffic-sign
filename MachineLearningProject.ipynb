        "# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Few-Shot Learning in Traffic Sign Recognition Tasks\n",

        "<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n",
        "<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; font-weight: normal;margin-right: 20px;\">Nowadays, self-driving vehicles is one of the main application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which has been most widely used in daily-life scenarios. These vehicles are based on many AI models among which there are traffic sign recognition systems. Different proposals have been provided for these systems, most of which rely on the usage of large datasets such as GTSRB (dataset of German traffic signs). Collecting a big amount of data is one of the main problems of Machine Learning models, which need lots of evidences in order to being able to generalize well. The cost of collecting more data than available can be one of the main aspects to consider during the development of these systems. Furthermore, using a big dataset exposes the model to possible Adversarial attacks, such as poisoning attacks, especially in case of out-source training and testing. For these reasons, in this work we investigate the application of a state-of-art (S.O.T.A.) Few-shot Learning (FSL) model, called LDC, on the traffic sign recognition domain. The aim of this work is to compare few-shot performance with non-few-shot ones by using different kinds of S.O.T.A. and baseline models on multiple datasets. The comparison is performed statistically using a Paired T-test.</p>\n",

        "- Choose $K$ different and independent datasets on which evaluate the models\n",
        "- For each dataset, we evaluate the models using a stratified 5-fold Cross Validation (CV). The stratified methodology plans to split the folds such that, the portion of samples associated with each label is the same for each fold. The evaluation metric used in the macro average F1 score on the test fold.\n",
        "- At each iteration of the CV, the test set is composed by using one fold as also the training set using the remaining $4$ folds. In order to train the few-shot model in a $N$-way $K$-shot scenario, we extract another dataset from the training one, by picking $K$ samples for each label at random, forming the training dataset used for the few-shot model.\n",
        "- The test is still paired since both of the models are tested on the same test fold and generally evaluated on the same datasets.\n",
